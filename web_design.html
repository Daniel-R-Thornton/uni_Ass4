                        I have been using React for 4 years and it has been my go-to framework for all my personal
                        projects. With React, I have created full stack web applications. Its ability to develop
                        single page applications allows for quick and efficient development with minimal code and
                        high reusability.

                        For over 10 years, I have been proficient in HTML, which I use in conjunction with CSS to
                        structure my web pages. I have utilized HTML to create numerous simple websites and plugins
                        for commercial applications.

                        I have over 10 years of experience with CSS, and it is one of my core strengths in web design. I
                        am adept at utilizing CSS to create visually appealing and engaging user interfaces. Here are a
                        few examples of my CSS skills in action:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Customizing website layouts by utilizing CSS grid and flexbox, providing responsive designs
                            that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creating engaging animations and transitions using CSS keyframes and transforms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Styling form elements and user input fields with CSS to provide a consistent and intuitive
                            user experience, improving usability and accessibility.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implementing CSS frameworks Tailwind CSS to streamline the development.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    With my CSS expertise, I can transform your web projects into visually appealing and user-friendly
                    experiences, ensuring that they are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.

                    <p>
                        I have 4 years of experience with JavaScript. I have used it to develop the back end of
                        applications using Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, I have utilized JavaScript for
                        front-end development with React.js and React Native. While I prefer TypeScript for better
                        code quality and bug prevention, I am equally comfortable with JavaScript.
